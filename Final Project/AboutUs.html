      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>Biruktawit Hailemariam, Owner
      <p>I've always had a larger than life personality with a very healthy appetite for success. I strongly believe that having the confidence behind the vision is only half the battle the other half is having the will power to actually do what you vision in the first place. I live life with an open mind and fill any empty space with thoughts of success. I remind myself every day that every successful person started somewhere and I'm no different. You've got to identify your talents, value yourself enough to know that others will too and go for it. It's as simple as that.".</p>
      <p>  We value every single one of our clients and we are committed to delivering the highest level of integrity in everything we do.
We believe that life is a series of moments. Some of those moments make us laugh, other moments take our breath away. And then there are the truly special moments, the ones that we think about and plan for ages, and it is these fairytale moments that we at Real Fairytale Weddings want to help you turn from dreams into reality. It is these special milestone moments that we live for!
