    <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, which is a markup language used for encoding documents in a format that can be read by both humans and machines. It is a flexible format that can be used for data exchange between different applications and platforms. XML uses tags to define elements and attributes to provide additional information about those elements.

  <h3>How is XML used</h3>
    <p>XML is commonly used for data exchange, as it provides a standard way of structuring data that can be interpreted by different applications. It is often used for web services, as it allows for data to be easily exchanged between a web server and a client. It can also be used for storing data in a structured format.. </p>
    <h3> What does XML look like? (provide an example)</h3>

  <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
  <P>JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for web development. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs in a user's web browser rather than on a web server. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages, such as validating user input, responding to user actions, and manipulating the content of web pages.</p>
    <h3>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS? </h3>
    <p>HTML is used to structure the content of a web page, while CSS is used to style that content. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to that content, such as responding to user actions and manipulating the content of the page. JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML code, or it can be included in a separate file and linked to the HTML code.If ive to explain in most simple words for their relationship is like HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin or muscles, and Javascript is the brain.
      <h3>What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions? (provide at least 1 example of each)</h3>
