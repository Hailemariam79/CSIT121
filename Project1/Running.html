    <p>Running is the one of the activity’s that’s I physically exhausting but mentally and emotionally recharging. Every single run presents a new challenge, a new opportunity to push myself. I was number 1 for 5k Maryland healthcare Access on this picture, I love the feeling of crossing the finish line, no matter what the distance or how long it takes me.  Finishing is what makes me start, and it’s what keeps me going when I am tempted to quit</p>
